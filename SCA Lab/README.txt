This is the python version of the CPA lab for the SCA section of the hardware security course.

If you are more familiar with python than with Matlab then you may wish to do your lab using python.

As with lab 1, there's a jupyter notebook for you to use if you have jupyter installed.
However, in this case the code is also copied into a regular .py file for those that wish to 
use a regular text editor instead of jupyter notebook.

The code for this lab only requires two libraries:
matplotlib
numpy

If you have conda or pip installed then it should be easy to download these libraries.

Read the instructions carefully and think about how to solve each step. If you know what to do
the lab requires you to write less than 10 lines of code!
